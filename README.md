Once upon a time, you managed your Github repositories,

the pull requests and the commits... didn't yoooou?

# `botdylan`: Automate your Github processes with js scripts.

`botdylan` runs as a daemon. It's configured by writing a `config.json` file
that describes `cron` and `hooks` scripts. `cron` scripts execute periodically
and `hook` scripts execute on `github hook` events.

```
$ ls /etc/botdylan
scripts/hooks
scripts/crons
config.json

$ botdylan --dir /etc/botdylan
```

## Why?

`botdylan` was initially built and used internally at [Teambox](http://teambox.com).

We use Github heavily. There are some repetitive tasks that were taking away our time
to hack on a better product. Since we are in the productivity space we decided to
stop doing things manually and start to have a more productive environment to work with.

The project is heavily inspired by [hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot).

## Command line options

`botdylan` has just one CLI option:

  * `--dir [current_path]`: Location of your `scripts` folder and `config.json`.

## Config.json

Configuring botdylan is damn simple! Just populate your `config.json` file on your
configuration directory with the following options:

  * `username`: Bot username
  * `password`: Bot password
  * `repositories`: Hash of repositories (owner/repository) with the `cron` and `hooks` setted up
  * `port [80]`: Port to listen github webhooks
  * `silent [false]`: Flag to disable output

``` javascript
{
  "username": "botdylan"
, "password": "blood-on-the-tracks"
, "url": "http://example.com"
, "port": 5000
, "repositories": {
    "botdylan/test": {
      "crons": {
        "0 0 0 * * *": ["ping"]
      }
    , "hooks": {
        "issue_comment": ["pong"]
      , "push" : ["cowboys"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Scripts under `scripts/hooks` will run on any given [hook event](http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/),
`botdylan` will create the hooks automatically if they don't exist.

Scripts under `scripts/crons` use the `cron` syntax.

## How to write `botdylan` scripts?

The scripts have to export a single function that will be executed by
`botdylan`.

Cron scripts receive:
  - `bot`
  - `repo_info`

Hooks scripts receive:
  - `bot`
  - `repo_info`
  - `payload`

You will find plenty of examples under the `scripts` folder.

## The `bot` helper object

This object represents our beloved bot. It has some methods to help you write your scripts:

  - `trace`: Write a message to the console unless the `silent` option is sent
  - `options`: Options from your `config.json` file
  - `handleError`: Function applicator that handles showing errors if any
  - `github`: Authenticated `GitHubApi` instance of
              [node-github](https://github.com/ajaxorg/node-github)
  - `http`: A [request](https://github.com/mikeal/request) instance
  - `events`: Contains a `on` and an `emit` message. Ideal to communicate between scripts
  - `store`: A getter/setter memory storage.

# TODO

There are plenty of things that we would like to have soon done:

  - More scripts! Most of them can be imported from hubot which we love <3
  - `scripts/events` to be able to create scripts that are invoked from custom events
  - Better tools for bot to reduce the boilerplate on the scripts
  - Better documentation and how to script guides
